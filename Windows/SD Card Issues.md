Install the driver for the steam deck and reboot, resolved the issue instantly for me.

Driver is stored in this repo under directory **Drivers**

Driver is: BayHub_SD_STOR_installV3.4.01.89_W10W11_logoed_20220228.zip

# Note

While the reddit thread is about steam deck this worked for my asus laptop as well.
