Pretty straight forward use, but some extra notes.

# Buttons

- **Mode** - select Mode
- **Display** - Cycles through display options (eg time, mA, mAH, voltage).
- **Current** - alows setting charging cuarrent, default is 500mA, system max (combined slots mA) 2000mA.
- **Slot** - allows you to select a single slot or all slots (if bult testing you usually want all)

# Test Batteries

To check a batteries capacity & internal resistance

## Charge Test Mode

1. charge cell
2. discharge cell
3. charge cell

shows total mAh when done

## Quick Test mode

measures internal resistance

notes:

- contact resistance can play a big part, firmly seat cells. try different slots as well.
- 30mOhm should be deducted from reading to account for tools internal resistance
