Blackview used to be very good quality and robust, but with the BL8800 pro Ive had the same fault twice. It seems to be the battery connection will come loose due to vibration or being dropped, not what you want from a phone marketed as being a tough phone.

Additionally the flir module will stop working and simply needs to be replaced, these two issues are quite common for the model, this all points to poor build quality and complete lack of quality control.

Phone repair shops Ive reached out to wont even touch any phone thats not samsung or iphone, so they really should just call themselves 3rd party shops for samsung and iphone.
